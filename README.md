# File Compression and Indexing System Documentation

## Project Overview
The File Compression and Indexing System is a comprehensive file management solution that combines efficient compression algorithms with advanced data structures for file organization. This system enables users to compress text files using Huffman coding while providing powerful indexing capabilities through B-Tree/B+ Tree and Red-Black Tree implementations.
